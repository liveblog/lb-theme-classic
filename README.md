# Classic Theme Theme repo is **DEPRECATED**

Last update to this repository has been done with Liveblog v3.4.0 release.
As of now, any new changes will be only available under our monorepo approach.

We integrated a monorepo approach and the source code is now kept in the liveblog repo
in the `server/liveblog/themes/themes_assets/classic`
Link to the `master branch` to the following [path](https://github.com/liveblog/liveblog/tree/master/server/liveblog/themes/themes_assets/classic)

## Compatibility

For Live Blog version 3.2.2 or previous, make sure to use <a href="https://github.com/liveblog/lb-theme-classic/releases/tag/v3.2.1">version 3.2.1 of the Classic theme</a>.

The latest version of the Classic theme only works with Live Blog version 3.3 or higher.
